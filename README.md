# Calculator

This project is a calculator made in vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project idea was given from The Odin Project; however, all functioning code and design was created from scratch by me.

This calculator makes use of HTML's onclick attributes to collect button values and store data. Multiple if-else statements were used to cover scenarios that would trouble the user.

This calculator is at a point where it can function properly and does not need any further bug fixs, however, some designs that may be implemented in the future are written below:
